* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[The biggest challenge I faced was trying to speed up the pitch I kinda got it working but then my buttons werent producing sounds after it had ran through for awhile and randomly generate a pattern and get it to work randomly I think I could have eventually figured it out but I just happened to no
find out about this internship oppurtunity just a few days before the deadline and also had mid terms the same week.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I am really curious about actually making a fully functioning responsive website, after just doing this small submission which seemed like a really practical
project was extremely difficult so im just comparing it to other websites that has way more functioning features.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would have spent them trying to randomly generate my pattern, that was the most important additional feature to me because my game could easily be beaten
after just a few times playing it to remember the order]
